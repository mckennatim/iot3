### functions
#### button
Edgewater operation can be kicked off by pressing a button. It just turns on the first relay. In edgewater, there is only one toggle button target, sr = 0, and the data to change is data[0], onoff. `inp.i_updInputs()` changes the state of an sr (0) relay
* only the first relay is changed and it can only turn it on and off.
* goes through all the inputs (there is only one here), then traverses the sensors types looking for a match for in this case `toggle`
* for `toggle`, if a button is pressed, the target(s) of that button get changed. The first get is the sr, `int sr = inp[ix].tar[0].gets[m][0];`, the second `gets[m][1]` is the index in the srs data array that it should update, it just toggles the sr's data[da] value `srs[sr].data[da] = !srs[sr].data[da];` and sets a flag that the srs[sr] has changed has changed `u_setFlag(sr, &f.HAYsTATEcNG)`

The relay is changed programmatically, 
* when sending a cmd from the front end you can change both onoff and the tsec
* when the timer has finished 

#### `req.desiriCmd()` 
* when receiving a cmd from the front end 
* you can change both onoff and the tsec in srs
* ex: {"id":0,"darr":[0,20,1,-1,-1]}
* grabs the sr which is the `id` of the CY.../cmd. 
* cmds is also the name of the data structure an array of all sr's that can be commanded. Each is of the form `{0, 2, {0, 1}}, //relay zone {sr,nda,data{}` where dax = nda, the number of data elements in data{}. that data, onoff and tsec, is copied over to srs, 

```
  for(int i=0;i<dax;i++){ 
    int idx = cmds[sr].data[i]; //srs data index for the cmd data
    srs[sr].data[idx]= sra[i];
  }
```
* the data here are indexes for where in the srs data you should put the new cmd `darr[i] AKA sra[i] ` data. 
* sets a flag that the srs[sr] has changed has changed `u_setFlag(sr, &f.HAYsTATEcNG)`


#### `inp.i_updCtrl()` 
* gets called every200msec in loop
* after processing, always checks if the relay state is different than the setting and flips it if need be.
* it finds an on relay, or if it finds an off relay whose prioronoff=1 it stores tsec in `sTRTsWtIMR[sr]`
* if relay set to off with a prionoff=1
  * it turns it on and sets prionoff=1
  * if this is the last relay (nxtsr=-1), 
* goes through al the sr's looking for any that have been changed `u_setFlag(sr, &f.HAYsTATEcNG)` by `toogle` or `cmd`
* then it looks up, using the srs typidx to find in `tds_t tds` the array record for that idx. 2 is `{"relay", 5, {"onoff", "tsec", "nxtsr", "priosr", "prionoff", }}` 
* if the srs[sr].data[0] is on and tsec > 0 then sTRTsWtIMR[sr] = millis(); and u_setFlag(sr,&f.ISrELAYoN);
    * if nextsr>-1 then set srs[nextsr].data[4] prionoff to 1
* else if it finds the prior relay is off and the current relay shows prionoff is on, then it updates prioronoff to off and sets the current relay on. 
  * reset srs[sr].prionoff to 0 
  * turn on srs[sr].onoff to on
* if the relay is different overwrite it and set dOpUBLISH for the sr
* next loop(), it will see an on relay and grab its tsec value into `sTRTsWtIMR[sr]`

```
srs_t srs[NUMSR] ={//{sr, port, typidx, data[]}   
  {0, D0, 2, {0, 2400, 1, -1, -1,}}, //relay zone1 
  {1, D6, 2, {0, 2400, 2, 0, 0,}}, //relay zone2 
  {2, D7, 2, {0, 2400, 3, 1, 0,}}, //relay zone3 
  {3, D8, 2, {0, 2400, -1, 2, 0,}}, //relay zone4 
  {4, D1, 2, {0, 2400, -1, -1, -1,}}, //relay zone5 
```
#### `i_updRelays()`
* called every 200ms from loop()
* Checks all the on relays `(f.ISrELAYoN & sr2) ==sr2 `
  * reads the srs setting tsec
  * double checks if relay is on `if(srs[sr].data[0]==)1)`. If someone re-tapped the button it could be off.
  * When `inp.i_updCtrl()` finds a relay set to on, it saves tmsec in `sTRTsWtIMR[sr]`. If the elapsed time is greater than the setting (.data[1]*1000), then the relay gets turned off, f.ISrELAYoN & f.HAYsTATEcNG get unset.
  * if nxtsr is set to continue, that relay has it's flag set. `u_setFlag(nxtsr, &f.HAYsTATEcNG);`. 
    * next time through `inp.i_updCtrl()` checks a relay and finds the prior relay is off and the current relay shows prionoff == 1

### Status
* client evironment http://localhost/react/v18o/iot/edgewater/dist/ is working
* device C:\fs\iot3\my is compiling and building. 

When message is sent from client it reaches the device but there is hardly any response and nothing gets sent back to the client

PROBLEMS

* Relay programming doesn't stick
* data gets lost on reboot
