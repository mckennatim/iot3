`inp.i_updInputs()` changes the state of an sr relay
* goes through all the inputs, then traverses the sensors types looking for a match for in this case `toggle`
* for `toggle`, if a button is pressed, the target(s) of that button get changed. The first get is the sr, `int sr = inp[ix].tar[0].gets[m][0];`, the second `gets[m][1]` is the index in the srs data array that it should update, it just toggles the sr's data[da] value `srs[sr].data[da] = !srs[sr].data[da];` and sets a flag that the srs[sr] has changed has changed `u_setFlag(sr, &f.HAYsTATEcNG)`

The relay is changed programmatically
* when sending a cmd from the front end
* when the timer has finished 

`req.desiriCmd()` when sending a cmd from the front end
* grabs the sr which is the `id` of the
