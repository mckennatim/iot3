`inp.i_updInputs()` changes the state of an sr relay
* goes through all the inputs, then traverses the sensors types looking for a match for in this case `toggle`
* for `toggle`, if a button is pressed, the target(s) of that button get changed. The first get is the sr, `int sr = inp[ix].tar[0].gets[m][0];`, the second `gets[m][1]` is the index in the srs data array that it should update, it just toggles the sr's data[da] value `srs[sr].data[da] = !srs[sr].data[da];` and sets a flag that the srs[sr] has changed has changed `u_setFlag(sr, &f.HAYsTATEcNG)`

The relay is changed programmatically
* when sending a cmd from the front end
* when the timer has finished 

`req.desiriCmd()` when sending a cmd from the front end 
* ex: {"id":0,"darr":[0,20,1,-1,-1]}
* grabs the sr which is the `id` of the CY.../cmd. 
* cmds is also the name of the data structure an array of all sr's that can be commanded. Each is of the form `{0, 2, {0, 1}}, //relay zone {sr,nda,data{}` where dax = nda, the number of data elements in data{}

```
  for(int i=0;i<dax;i++){ 
    int idx = cmds[sr].data[i]; //srs data index for the cmd data
    srs[sr].data[idx]= sra[i];
  }
```
* the data here are indexes for where in the srs data you should put the new cmd `darr[i] AKA sra[i] ` data. 
* sets a flag that the srs[sr] has changed has changed `u_setFlag(sr, &f.HAYsTATEcNG)`

It should be noted that 




Status
* client evironment http://localhost/react/v18o/iot/edgewater/dist/ is working
* device C:\fs\iot3\my is compiling and building. 

When message is sent from client it reaches the device but there is hardly any response and nothing gets sent back to the client

PROBLEMS

* Relay programming doesn't stick
* data gets lost on reboot
